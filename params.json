{"name":"More Than Just a Game: Understanding Win Conditions in League of Legends","tagline":"","body":"### The Rise of eSports\r\nProfessional sports in the United States is a multi-billion dollar industry. In addition to paid professional players, numerous jobs regarding data analytics in sports occupy the industry. What is the best formation for this football team? What order should the team bat in? In an industry where winning is key, optimal strategies designed to win are constantly sought after.\r\n\r\nBut physical sports aren't the only competitive environment that requires analysis of optimal strategy. Here's another picture of a newly emerging group of professional \"eSports\" athletes: \r\n\r\n<img src = http://i.imgur.com/Dbs3fhb.jpg style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\r\nWhile it may seem proposterous to think that professional video games are anywhere near as large as professional sports, consider this fact; excluding the Super Bowl, the League of Legends (the currently most popular video game in the world) World Championship Final was the highest viewed event, at 36 million viewers in 2015. Yes, [it beat the NBA Finals and the World Series.]([http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14320491/an-oral-history-league) Here's a picture of the 2015 finals, held in the Brussels Expo in Belgium: \r\n\r\n<img src = http://d3psvddqt9zx7g.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/League-of-Legends-world-championship.jpg>\r\n\r\nGames like League of Legends have competitive scenes that have been rapidly growing, both in size and exposure. With these increased stakes, much effort has been put into detailed analysis of the game. Similar to how a sports analyst would look for optimal strategy in a game of football, video game analysts look for winning compositions (which characters to pick), which items to buy, or where to be at what time of the game. Having the right strategy could be the difference between being the best in the world or going home second. \r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the League of Legends competitive scene has trickled from professional play all the way down to the collegiate level; Harvard too has its own League of Legends team. Currently, Harvard's team is part of a national Collegiate League of Legends Championship tournament with a first place prize of $150,000 for the team. \r\n\r\nBut before we delve too much into the project, it's important that you understand the basics of how League of Legends works. Similar to a basketball game, a game of League of Legends pits 5 players against 5. Either team wins by destroying the enemy Nexus, a building located at each team's base. Standing in the way of this goal, however, are many different obstacles. Each player chooses one of 128 different \"champions.\" These champions fight each other, gain resource called \"gold\" (which is obtained by killing enemy champions, towers, or AI-controlled 'minions') to buy items that make them stronger, and push down turrets and inhibitors - buildings that defend the path to the nexus to win. Along the course of the game, there are many other objectives (dragon, baron, neutral monsters), which for purposes of this project can simply be considered \"side objectives\" that give players more resources to beat the other team. Games usually last between 20 and 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nHere is where our project comes in: we want to find out what the most important aspects of the game are. Obviously the end goal is to take down the enemy Nexus, but there are many different ways to gather resources and strategize; a team can seek to take down towers as quickly as possible, while another team may look to get as many dragon kills as possible to gain enough strength to take down the nexus. A possible analogy one could use is strategy in American football; should a team pass or run more? Should the defense blitz or play a safe zone-coverage? These type of questions are the ones we want to ask in the world of League of Legends.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important? Basically, we want to know <b> what wins games and when they are won</b>. Along the process of a game, there are several metrics that tell how well a player is doing (examples include how much gold he/she has earned, how many champion kills he has had, etc.). We want to know if there are specific factors that are particularly important in determining which team will win, and at what point in the game these factors are determined. Knowing this information will be vital to team strategy, as it will change the objectives that we focus on, the type of champions we will pick, or the playstyle that we have. Finally, this project will help all League of Legends players understand how \"set\" games are at certain time periods. Similar to how, say, the winner of a game of basketball is almost 100% determined if one team is 20 points ahead with 5 minutes of game time remaining, we want to know how different metrics at different times in a game of League of Legends can accurately predict which team will win.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
